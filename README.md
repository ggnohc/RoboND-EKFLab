# RoboND-EKFLab

This is archive for Robotics ND Term 2, Lesson 11 Kalman Filter Labs.  All steps demonstrated were able to be reproduced.

All packages has been uploaded and just need to do a git clone and move file/folders to "catkin_ws/src" folder, except "turtlebot" package (Lesson 11.7 TurtleBot Teleop Package) as too many files in the folder.
